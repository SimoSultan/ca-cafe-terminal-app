## Description

A program that will show the user a menu, ask for their order or quit, input item quantities, see their running order and finally their bill.

## Motivation

To omplement a simple cafe app with a combination of concepts learnt so far and keeping the code DRY. We were practicing methods in Ruby, and this was the challenge that was given, and I went a bit overboard. Code is spaghetti of today's standards yes. But just fulfilling the requirement of the challenge.

## Copyright, ethical, social issues

Copyright wasn't thought to be of concern as the game is free, open sourced and a text-based game. The only issue that was raised before development was that it can't associate with any particular branding qualities from a learning to code course. This made the game text more generic, departing from any issues surrounding this.
